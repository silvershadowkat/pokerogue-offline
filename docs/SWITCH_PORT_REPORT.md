# Nintendo Switch Milestone 2 and Beta handoff report

## Summary

Milestone 2 replaces the small release payload with the real
SilverShadow-patched PokéRogue web build while retaining the hardware-proven
nx.js bootstrap and diagnostics. The result is a hardware-testable, offline,
SD-card-oriented package. The first release established a playable
real-hardware baseline; version 2.0.0 is the second Switch release and promotes
the port to Beta. It reaches battles, catches Pokémon, persists
Pokédex/session data, and resumes a run. It is not claimed stable.

The detailed hardware record is maintained in
[`SWITCH_BETA_STATUS.md`](SWITCH_BETA_STATUS.md).

## Logical changes and commits

The branch history intentionally preserves the major implementation stages:

1. `247e4cc` through `8458f20`: architecture, nx.js Phaser proof of concept,
   patch hooks, and Milestone 1 hardware evidence.
2. `22a1b01` through `2470757`: pinned real-game cache/build, external package
   loader, verification, documentation, and measured build results.
3. `0a697b6` through `77ba54b`: hardware-driven compatibility fixes for fonts,
   unsupported regular expressions, timestamped logs, DOM APIs, WebGL2, video,
   XHR asset loading, audio-listener startup, UI state, framebuffer scaling,
   text metrics, Nintendo controls, Plus interception, and bitmap-font XML.

The complete blocker-to-commit table is in `SWITCH_BETA_STATUS.md`.

```

The pre-report validation package contained one 56,492,289-byte fat NRO, a
610,691,949-byte ZIP, 34,116 ZIP entries, and 20 JavaScript files. The final
metadata-only regeneration can change the exact byte counts without changing
the payload layout.

## Cache design

The cache separates upstream Git objects, disposable worktrees, pnpm content,
npm/pnpm/immutable downloads, extracted assets, metadata, and exact-key
compiled intermediates. Immutable tarballs are validated against recorded
SHA-256 values. The observed archive hashes were:

- assets:
  `82cdf0d9168b40483b139a0902fc8f6bc92233ab68c949f865fd02217aeb728b`
- locales:
  `fd8312e628d1c8662e610ef741cda10c0e9c3b9970aac9e93e7f53f40f6c830b`

GitHub Actions uses separate safe caches for npm/nx.js downloads, the pnpm
store, exact upstream Git objects, immutable assets, and the exact compiled
intermediate. Only package/download stores receive partial restore keys.

## Build timing and cache observations

Measured on the local Windows validation host:

- clean-cache `npm ci` plus full package and verification: `309.310` seconds;
- complete cached package and verification: `109.362` seconds;
- exact compiled-intermediate reuse within that cached build: `0.053` seconds;
- forced offline intermediate rebuild plus offline package and verification:
  `263.306` seconds, including a `147.502`-second intermediate rebuild.

ZIP assembly is the dominant cached cost because the 610 MB-class external
payload is deliberately recreated and reverified.

Observed cache-miss categories on the first real build:

- upstream repository: MISS, populated from a clean local Git-object seed;
- upstream commit: PRESENT;
- assets archive: MISS;
- locales archive: MISS;
- exact pnpm CLI: POPULATED;
- pnpm store: POPULATED;
- compiled intermediate: REBUILT.

Observed cache-hit categories on the second real build:

- upstream repository: HIT;
- assets/locales: HIT;
- pnpm CLI/store: HIT;
- compiled intermediate: REUSED.

## Validation status

Executed and passed:

- exact shared-then-Switch patch application;
- real Vite app build;
- 2,720 transformed modules;
- 14,273 minified JSON files;
- no-import 8,822,479-byte controlled entry generation;
- Switch TypeScript typecheck;
- nx.js bootstrap bundle;
- fat NRO generation;
- complete ZIP generation;
- schema and checksum validation;
- critical asset-tree validation;
- Milestone 1-only rejection checks;
- NRO placement/duplication checks;
- ZIP central-directory verification;
- shell and Node syntax checks;
- successful measured clean-cache package build;
- measured cached package build and compiled-intermediate reuse;
- measured forced offline intermediate rebuild and package build;
- final Android/origin-main diff audit;
- mojibake scan;
- `git diff --check`;
- final clean branch/worktree confirmation.

Hardware-verified:

- external async-function evaluation under nx.js;
- Phaser WebGL2 game creation and real asset rendering;
- title, starter selection, Pokédex, party, reward, and battle screens;
- readable text and correct 1280x720 scaling;
- attached-controller D-pad and Nintendo A/B behavior;
- catching, reward progression, Pokédex persistence, active-session
  persistence, and Continue Run.

Still requires real Switch hardware:

- working audio;
- correct dynamic battle-animation textures;
- safe Plus handling across scenes;
- suspend/resume, controller reconnection, and long-session memory behavior;
- docked and additional controller configurations;
- save import/export and software-keyboard flows.

## Known blockers and risks

The established Beta defects are:

- silent music and sound effects;
- Phaser `__MISSING` textures in move animations despite local PNG requests;
- approximately 35-44 seconds of black screen during cold boot;
- keyboard/Xbox artwork in some controller prompts;
- one native software crash after Plus during a rival battle, with no
  JavaScript exception after the `beforeunload` interception;
- unknown memory behavior after settings-driven in-process reloads;
- unverified lifecycle, docked, alternate-controller, import/export, and
  software-keyboard paths.

The next branch should add memory and Phaser loader diagnostics before changing
input or renderer behavior. See `SWITCH_BETA_STATUS.md` for the ordered path
forward.

The local Codex Windows sandbox cannot create the normal `%LOCALAPPDATA%`
default cache because its execution account is ACL-isolated. Validation uses a
short writable `SILVERSHADOW_CACHE_DIR` override. A normal user PowerShell
session and GitHub Actions use the documented default/explicit cache roots.

## Required hardware feedback

Return the exact items in `docs/SWITCH_INSTALL.md`, especially
the newest `logs/milestone2-*.log`, the screen photo, console/runtime versions, title
override state, controller arrangement, Wi-Fi state, the last startup stage,
and whether storage and deliberate missing-file failures behaved as described.
